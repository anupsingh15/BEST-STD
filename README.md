## About

This repository provides a fast and efficient speech tokenization approach using bidirectional Mamba for spoken term detection.  The proposed method employs a speech tokenizer that generates speaker-agnostic tokens, ensuring consistent token sequences across different utterances of the same word. The repository includes the implementation, datasets, and pre-trained models.
