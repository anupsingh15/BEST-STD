## About

This repository provides a fast and efficient speech tokenization approach using bidirectional Mamba for spoken term detection.  The proposed method employs a speech tokenizer that generates speaker-agnostic tokens, ensuring consistent token sequences across different utterances of the same word. The repository includes the implementation, datasets, and pre-trained models.

## Setup

#### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/anupsingh15/BEST-STD.git
cd BEST-STD
```

#### Create a Virtual Environment
```sh
conda create -n best_std anaconda
```

Alternatively, you can replicate the Conda environment with the additional dependencies included:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate best_std
```

#### Install Dependencies
```sh
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
python -m pip install lightning
pip install vector-quantize-pytorch
pip install mamba-ssm
pip install causal-conv1d>=1.4.0
python -m pip install tslearn
pip install librosa
```

## Usage

To train the model, run:  
```sh
python main.py
```

To create the database, build the index, and perform retrieval, run:
```sh
python retrieval/std.py
```

For a demonstration of word tokenization, check the following Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
